<h4 align="center">Currently Studying</h4>

<div align="left">

I'm enrolled in a Computer Engineering program at the University of Granada (UGR) while also pursuing the 42 cursus in Málaga. These two educational pathways offer me a well-rounded experience, combining academic rigor with practical, hands-on coding challenges.

At UGR, I'm gaining a solid foundation in core computer science concepts, including algorithms, data structures, and software engineering. The theoretical knowledge I acquire here serves as the bedrock for my future endeavors in tech.

In contrast, the 42 cursus in Málaga provides an immersive, project-based learning environment. This experience is honing my problem-solving skills and helping me adapt to real-world coding scenarios.

Ultimately, my aim is to become an expert in Computer Engineering, with the skill set to contribute meaningfully to complex and impactful tech projects.
