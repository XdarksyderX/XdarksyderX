<h4 align="center">Currently Studying</h4>

<div align="left">

I'm enrolled in a Computer Science program at the University of Granada (UGR) while also pursuing the 42 cursus in Málaga. These two educational pathways offer me a well-rounded experience, combining academic rigor with practical, hands-on coding challenges.

At UGR, I'm gaining a solid foundation in core computer science concepts, including algorithms, data structures, and software engineering. The theoretical knowledge I acquire here serves as the bedrock for my future endeavors in tech.

In contrast, the 42 cursus in Málaga provides an immersive, project-based learning environment. This experience is honing my problem-solving skills and helping me adapt to real-world coding scenarios.

Ultimately, my aim is to become an expert in Computer Engineering, with the skill set to contribute meaningfully to complex and impactful tech projects.

<h4 align="center" >🌟 Professional Aspiration</h4>

My foremost ambition is to contribute significantly to society by creating impactful, value-driven solutions. In the short term, I am dedicated to refining my technical expertise and keeping abreast of the latest industry trends. Over the long haul, my goal is to intertwine technology with aspects of psychology and philosophy, leading initiatives that are deeply rooted in human-centric values.



<h4 align="center">📚 Interests</h4>

I'm a naturally curious individual who enjoys diving deep into various subjects. Outside the tech world, my interests are quite diverse. I have a love for video games, whether it's the challenge of competitive gaming or the narratives of story-driven titles. Music is another passion, serving both as a creative outlet and a source of inspiration. Additionally, I have a soft spot for cats, appreciating their independent yet affectionate nature.
